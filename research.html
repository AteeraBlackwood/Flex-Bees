      <p class= "columnPara paraLeft">Honey bees perform about 80 percent of all pollination worldwide. A single bee colony(which averages from 20,000 to 80,000 individual bees) can pollinate up to 300 million flowers each day.The plants that provide us fruits, nuts, and vegetables are pollinated by bees, resulting in 70 out of the top 100 human food crops.</p>
      <p class= "columnPara paraRight">However, according to Greenpeace.org, in the U.S., winter losses have commonly reached 30-50 percent, an amount thatâ€™s unsustainable for a hive population. U.S. National Agricultural Statistics show a honey bee decline from about 6 million hives in 1947 to 2.4 million hives in 2008, a 60 percent reduction. The number of working bee colonies per hectare provides a critical metric of crop health. In the U.S. the number of bee colonies per hectare has declined by 90 percent since 1962.</p>

        <p>Restore ecological agriculture.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ecological farming resists insect damage by avoiding large monocrops and preserving ecosystem diversity. Ecological farming restores soil nutrients with natural composting systems, avoids soil loss from wind and water erosion, and avoids pesticides and chemical fertilizers.

        <p>Ban the seven most dangerous pesticides.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pesticides like nicotine-based clothianidin, imidacloprid, thiametoxam, clorpyriphos, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, and fipronil wreak havoc on insect nervous systems and are commonly used in agriculture. These chemicals accumulate in bees and weaken them, increasing die-off.</li>
